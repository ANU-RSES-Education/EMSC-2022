# EMSC 2022

## Mantle convection and plate motions (ii)

*In which we concern ourselves with the observation of signals from the convecting mantle at the surface of the Earth and, perhaps, of the other terrestrial planets. We will see how mantle convection naturally
produces the pattern of heat flow in the oceans that we discussed in earlier lectures.*

## Observables

Quantitative information we can obtain about the dynamics of planetary interiors from remote sensing.

Which remote observations tell us what information ? 

  - **Gravity measurements**: density distribution
  - **Surface topography**: surface stress field
  - **Surface heat flow**: near surface temperature gradients
  - **Seismology**: elastic wave speed distribution
  - **Morphology**: deformation styles / relative ages
  - **E/M**: conductivity / magnetic susceptibility

None of these tells us directly what the flow is doing at depth —how to solve this and the uncertainty of rheological parameters.

## Recap from previous lecture

We assume the geometry of fully developed convection is as follows
  - Thin horizontal boundary layers where heat diffuses into the layer and is carried away by horizontal advection. 
  - These are connected by vertical boundary layers of similar dimension.
  - Approximately isothermal core, passively rotating, driven by the boundary layers.

Making all of these assumptions allows us to derive the relationships: 

$$ \mathrm{Nu} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{1/3}  \quad \quad \textrm{and}  \quad \quad  \mathrm{V}_\mathrm{mean} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{2/3} $$

## Recap from previous lecture


We saw that the we could predict the global heat flow by understanding the basic fluid dynamics of the convecting mantle. **How can we verify if our theoretical picture has anything to do with the real Earth ?**

We might try to look at the global heat flow to see if the numbers match, but, if we want to identify the convection patterns as well, we might need to look at variations in the heat flow.(e.g. can we see cold and hot regions ?). The problem is …

## Boundary Layer Theory

We can look a little bit harder at the convection model we have been using and try to take it one step further.

Consider what actually happens as the hot material arrives at the surface (on the left) and spreads out horizontally (to the right). It begins to cool off as it moves. Because the horizontal length scale of the boundary layer is larger than the vertical scale, this is almost like a 1d problem.

## Cooling lithosphere = Error Function

If we take a uniformly hot region and suddenly cool the boundary, the equation for the temperature as a function of time and space is:

$$ \frac{T-T_s}{T_0-T_s}  = \mathrm{erf} \left(  \frac{z}{2\sqrt{\kappa t}} \right) $$


*What is the erf  ?* -  It comes from probability theory and describes the probability of a value in a gaussian distribution having a value between -x and x. It might be hard to calculate, but it is easy enough to differentiate:

$$\textrm{erf}(x) = \int_{-x}^{x} e^{-t^2} dt $$

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function for a discussion.

Any point riding along with the plate sees a 1D cooling pattern underneath associated with the aging of the plate. This is a good approximation because lateral heat flow is small (small temperature gradients)

## Cooling Lithosphere: structure

Lithosphere / boundary layer thickness — pick an isotherm and follow it from ridge to trench.
Thickness $\delta$ changes systematically:

$$ \delta \propto \sqrt{\kappa t} \quad \quad \textrm{a.k.a} \quad \quad  \delta \propto \sqrt{\kappa x / V} $$
