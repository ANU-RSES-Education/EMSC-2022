    "# Jupyter Notebook: EMSC2022, Practical Week 1\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are documents capable of containing both computer code (e.g. python commands) and text elements (e.g., paragraphs of type, equations, figures, links, etcâ€¦). Notebook documents are both human-readable documents that can contain the description of an experimental analysis and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable computer code which can be run to perform data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Python language\n",
    "We'll be working with Python, which is a general purpose programming language. Python is free and over the last decade has become the *de facto* programming language for scientific data analysis and numerical modelling. Thousands of free packages have been developed by scientists around the world for performing different analyses in Python. These are easy to download and work with to help you solve specific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be starting with very simple Python commands, you can also find a free online Python tutorial here:\n",

    "## Structure of Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "Notebooks are split into \"cells\", which can contain text, python code, etc.\n",

    "### Adding a *text* cell\n",
    "If you want to display text, then a cell must be set as \"Markdown\" (this can be set in the toolbar). Markdown is a simple language often used to format text, you can specify font sizes, colours, equations, hyperlinks, etc., all using Markdown. You'll be able to see examples of Markdown in this notebook (i.e. the cells containing text). Once you have completed your Markdown in a cell, press Shift and Enter together and your formatted text will appear. If you want to edit the cell, just double-click it and the Markdown will appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding a *code* cell\n",
    "Python programming is based on you providing a sequence of commands. We can type these commands into a cell and set the cell as \"code\" (this is the default when you make a new cell, but can also be selected in the toolbar. Python then knows that the text is the cell is a sequence of commands that should be executed. If you want to execute the code in the cell, just hit Shift and Enter together.\n",

    "# Calculating the relative velocity of two plates based on an Euler pole\n",
    "In this example, we'll follow the calculation we performed in Section 2b of the practical. By reviewing the code you should be able to see how we can step through the calculation in terms of Python commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the equation for the relative velocity between two plates based on their shared Euler pole is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v = \\omega R \\sin \\theta$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v$ is the velocity, $\\omega$ is the rotational velocity, $R$ is Earth's radius and $\\theta$ is the angle between the pole and the point of interest (you can look at the Markdown in this cell to see how I wrote out the equation and symbols).\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"#\" symbol is a comment, which allows us to put short pieces of information directly after a command. Once Python see the # symbol it will ignore the rest of the text on that line and go onto the next line in the cell. This allows us to provide a brief piece of information without including a whole text cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's get started\n",
    "First, we'll import *NumPy*, which is a Python library that contains a large collection of mathematical functions that we'll need later. In the command below we tell Python that we want to \"import\" the *NumPy* library and that we'll refer to it in our code using the name *np*."
