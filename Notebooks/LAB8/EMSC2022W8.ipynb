    "# Introduction\n",
    "The philosophy of this practical is different to our previous sessions. Typically, we provide you a sequence of tasks to complete that lead you to a final answer and a demonstration of a given concept. In this practical we will take a \"reseach-lead\" approach, where you will conceive for yourself the scientific steps required to represent a plate tectonic process.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Your challenge is to devise a technique to estimate the properties of an Euler pole that approximates the relative motion of the South America and Africa tectonic plates over the last 47 million years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you should consider that the spreading rate at mid-ocean ridges is expected to vary as the sine of angle between the Euler pole and a given point on the ridge (we discussed this in the lectures).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important aspect of this practical exercise is for you to consider in detail how you can use the information available to estimate a pole position. Once you have developed a plan for estimating the Euler pole, then you can try to code it below. ***However, the key aim of this practical is for you to develop the concept and details of your estimation process, rather than your ability to code it in Python.***\n",

    "The map below shows a locations of the mid-Atlantic ridge and magnetic anomaly 21 in the South Atlantic between South America and Africa. Red lines and points on the map indicate transect locations where the position of magnetic anomaly 21 and the ridge have been recorded within given transform faults. Each transect is marked with a different letter for identification.\n",

    "***(1) Working in groups or alone, devise a method to estimate the Euler pole that is most consistent with the seafloor spreading information provided in the table above.***\n",
    "\n",
    "***(2) Write Python code in this Jupyter notebook to implement your method to estimate the Euler pole.*** The code below shows you how to enter the positional data. Once that is done, then you should implement your method."
