# Introduction to Mantle Dynamics (EMSC 2022)

This section of the course introduces the dynamics of the circulation in the Earth's mantle
and how this relates to Plate Tectonic motions.

## Lecture Notes

**Lecture 1** - In which we examine the nature of convection as a phenomenon that transfers heat and generates motion. We will see how we can extract a single number that tells us almost everything about how / whether convection takes place … and we will calculate this for the Earth’s mantle.

**Lecture 2** - In which we concern ourselves with the observation of signals from the convecting mantle at the surface of the Earth and, perhaps, of the other terrestrial planets. We will see how mantle convection naturally
produces the pattern of heat flow in the oceans that we discussed in earlier lectures.

## Concepts

  - The Earth's Mantle is a heat engine that turns the energy from radioactive decay and from the formation of the planet into the mechanical work of plate motions.

  - We can quantify these motions by understanding fluid convection under different conditions.

### Highly viscous flow 

  - University of Queensland Pitch Drop Experiment is the [longest running lab experiment in the world](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/pitch-drop-has-new-custodian-after-physicists-death-20130827-2sne4.html). It was set up to [demonstrate creeping viscous flow](https://theconversation.com/explainer-the-pitch-drop-experiment-33734) and inadvertently demonstrated the effect of temperature on viscosity.

  - The [Boston Molasses Flood](https://fyfluiddynamics.com/2019/01/today-marks-the-100th-anniversary-of-the-boston/) - Gravity currents, highly viscous flow and temperature dependent viscosity. An interesting [video about viscous flow](https://youtu.be/u5sYoUnp5A0) that might give you some intuition into viscosity.
