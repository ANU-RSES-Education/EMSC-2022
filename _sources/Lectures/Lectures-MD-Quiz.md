# Mantle Dynamics EMSC 2022 - Quiz

In this task, you will need to find out some extra information that
is not spelled out in the lecture notes. A complete answer to 
any question needs to cite where the information was found. 

Be critical - is the source reputable, and do other sources agree ? If not, maybe you need to look elsewhere.

:::{admonition} Q: Viscosity (2)
:class: hint

What is meant by the **viscosity** of a fluid (1).

What are the units of (dynamic) viscosity (1) ?

Note: There are two different definitions of viscosity: *dynamic* viscosity 
which usually has the symbol $\eta$ or sometimes $\mu$ and *kinematic* viscosity which is usually $\nu$ and is defined as $\eta/\rho$.

:::{admonition} Q: Rayleigh number (4)
:class: hint

Estimate the Rayleigh number of the Earth's mantle (2).

$$ 
Ra = \frac{g\rho\alpha\Delta T d^3}{\kappa \eta}
$$

Use the following values:

  - Gravity, $g \approx 10 \mathrm{m/s}^2$ through the mantle
  - Density, $\rho \approx 3000 \mathrm{kg/m}^3$
  - Thermal Expansivity, $\alpha \approx 10^{-5} \mathrm{K}^{-1}$
  - Temperature drop, $\Delta T \approx 2000 \mathrm{K}$
  - Thickness of the mantle, $d \approx 3000 \mathrm{km}$
  - Thermal diffusivity, $\kappa \approx 10^{-7} \mathrm{m}^2 / \mathrm{s}$
  - Viscosity, $\eta \approx 10^{22} \textrm{viscosity units (!)}$

How does this compare to the critical Rayleigh number and what does that
tell us about mantle convection (2) ?

:::{admonition} Q: Dimensionless Rayleigh number (2)
:class: hint

Show that the units of Rayleigh number disappear. 

$$ 
Ra = \frac{g\rho\alpha\Delta T d^3}{\kappa \eta}
$$

*Hint: first convert the units of viscosity into units of $m$, $kg$, $s$, using the idea that pressure is force per unit area*

:::{admonition} Q: Heat Engine (2)
:class: hint

What is meant by the term "Heat Engine" (1) ?

Why is it important to a *geologist* that the Earth's mantle is a heat engine. What does the heat engine drive (1) ?
