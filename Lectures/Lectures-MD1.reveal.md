## Mantle convection and plate motions

*In which we shall examine the nature of convection as a phenomenon that transfers heat and generates motion. We will see how we can extract a single number that tells us almost everything about how / whether convection takes place … and we will calculate this for the Earth’s mantle.*

## Mantle Convection

Convection in Earth’s interior is (a little bit) like a boiling pot (as we saw in a previous lecture)

</center>

The hot soup rises to the surface, spreads and begins to cool, and then sinks back to the bottom of the pot where it is reheated and rises again. **Why does hot soup rise and cold soup sink** ?

## General Observations on Convection

Without being particularly quantitative:


<div style="width:100%">


  - Hot liquid is more buoyant than cold material **and it tends to rise**
  - Cooler liquid is less buoyant and **therefore tends to sink**
  - This can only happen if the two can **move past each other**
  - Convection produces a self-stirring

</div>

![USGS-Convection](images/AWatchedPot.png)  <!-- .element style="float:right; width:25%" -->

Buoyancy forces are at work and viscous forces counteract these forces once the fluid is moving

$$
\textrm{buoyancy} \propto g \rho_0 \alpha(1-\Delta T)
$$

Convection like this will only work when the soup is heated from below or, in the case of the Earth, if it is heated from within by radioactivity. **( Can you see why ?)**

## General Observations on Convection

**Definition**:  Convection is the transfer of heat by the self-organised movement of a fluid. Free convection is when the fluid is stirred entirely by rising buoyant material and sinking negatively-buoyant material. (Forced convection is produced when the fluid is stirred mechanically).

Convection is one of the ways we transfer heat from hot regions to cold regions. Other ways that heat can be transferred include *radiation* and *conduction*.

## Heat Transfer by Conduction

**Definition**: Conduction is the transfer of heat (or electric current) from one substance to another by direct contact (lattice vibrations / electrons). The transfer is always from a higher temperature to a lower temperature. Denser substances are usually better conductors; metals are excellent conductors.

## Image v2 

For full control on the image, including the ability to use `reveal.js` 
container sizing etc, you can use `html`

<img class="r-stretch" data-src="images/AuWorldEQ.png">

```html

That is all
