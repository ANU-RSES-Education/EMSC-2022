## Concepts

The Earth's Mantle is a heat engine that turns the energy from radioactive decay and from the formation of the planet into the mechanical work of plate motions.

We can quantify these motions by understanding fluid convection under different conditions.

### Highly viscous flow 

  - University of Queensland Pitch Drop Experiment is the [longest running lab experiment in the world](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/pitch-drop-has-new-custodian-after-physicists-death-20130827-2sne4.html). It was set up to [demonstrate creeping viscous flow](https://theconversation.com/explainer-the-pitch-drop-experiment-33734) and inadvertently demonstrated the effect of temperature on viscosity.

  - The [Boston Molasses Flood](https://fyfluiddynamics.com/2019/01/today-marks-the-100th-anniversary-of-the-boston/) - Gravity currents, highly viscous flow and temperature dependent viscosity. An interesting [video about viscous flow](https://youtu.be/u5sYoUnp5A0) that might give you some intuition into viscosity.
