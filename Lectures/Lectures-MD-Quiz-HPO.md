# Mantle Dynamics EMSC 2022 - Quiz (Advanced / Optional)

In this task, you will need to find out some extra information that
is not spelled out in the lecture notes. A complete answer to 
any question needs to cite where the information was found. Be critical of what you find - is the source reputable, and do other sources agree ? If not, maybe you need to look elsewhere.


:::{admonition} Q: H1 - Heat flow / Velocity and Rayleigh number (10)
:class: hint

Complete the following table which has data obtained from numerical simulations of convection (these are actually the examples given lecture notes)


  | $\mathrm{Ra}$ |$\mathrm{Nu}$ | $\log_{10}(\mathrm{Nu})$ | $V_\mathrm{rms}$ | $\log_{10}(V_\mathrm{rms})$ |
  |-------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------  | --------------- |

  $10^1$    |     1.00     |             |         0.00      |     ---         |

Assuming that the heat flow (Nusselt number) and average (root mean square) velocity are related to Rayleigh number in the following way:

$$
    \mathrm{Nu} = A \cdot \mathrm{Ra}^\alpha
$$

$$
    V_\mathrm{rms} = B \cdot \mathrm{Ra}^\beta
$$

Find the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (e.g. by plotting a graph of $\log_{10}(\mathrm{Nu})$ against $\log_{10}(\mathrm{Ra})$) or by fitting a curve as we did in the lab.
