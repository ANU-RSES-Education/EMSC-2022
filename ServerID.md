 ## Comments
   
Get the install to match current version in underworld community 
Add the https configuration (update secrets IP address to be the DNS hostname)
The https config failed today (expired) and it may be necessary to reboot to get it working again.

2020.09.15 - Taken offline
2021.02.14 - Restore for 2021 with new IP, new droplet. This completely removes all history & logins etc
2021.02.14 - Fix DNS
2021.02.14 - geoscience.education is blocked by our firewall, sadly - use underworldcloud.org
2021.02.23 - Restore again to remove old authorization methods

2022.03.21 - Rebuild for 2022
