Get the install to match current version in underworld community 
Add the https configuration (update secrets IP address to be the DNS hostname)
The https config failed today (expired) and it may be necessary to reboot to get it working again.

2021.02.14 - Restore for 2021 with new IP, new droplet. This completely removes all history & logins etc
